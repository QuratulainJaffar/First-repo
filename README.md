Hi there,

I am currently trying to setup my first Github repo.

The project is about using a different technique which is fractal dimension analysis for detecting seismic signals.

Variogram method is used to estimate the fractal dimension of seismic signals.

I have uploaded one example of Debris flow event.

The variogram.ipynb includes the function to estimate fractal featuted.

 main.ipynb is file loading and initial processing.
 
Hope you'll find it cool.
